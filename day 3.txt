3.Difference between windows screen and documents
WINDOW
The JavaScript window object represents the browser window.
The window is the first thing that gets loaded into the browser and supported by all browsers.
The window object represents the current browsing context.

EXAMPLES:
window.open() : open a new window

window.close() : close the current window

window.moveTo() : move the current window

window.resizeTo() : resize the current window


DOCUMENTS:
The Document object represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web pageâ€™s content, 
which is the DOM tree. When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object. 
It is the root node of the HTML document.
The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.


EXAMPLES:
document.createElement(element) : Create an HTML element

document.removeChild(element) : Remove an HTML element

document.appendChild(element) : Add an HTML element

document.replaceChild(new, old) : Replace an HTML element


SCREEN

Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions of the user device.
It can be used to display screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc. 
It is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object like window.screen. 
It can be written without window prefix.


EXAMPLES
screen.width
screen.height
screen.availWidth
screen.availHeight
screen.colorDepth
screen.pixelDepth
